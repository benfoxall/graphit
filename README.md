this is based on the excellent [tutorial](https://dev.to/aspittel/how-to-create-the-drawing-interaction-on-dev-s-offline-page-1mbe) by Ali Spittel, and uses the same technique to generate a slope equation from a drawn line.

Connecting a physical action to the resulting mathematical equation could be
helpful for some learners who are more visual and like to "feel" the equations.

## extensions

- It would be nice to eventually have functionality for quadratic equations, but will need time to work on that.

- Eventually, learners attempting to draw a line from an equation might be able to
get feedback on how close their line is to the equation.
